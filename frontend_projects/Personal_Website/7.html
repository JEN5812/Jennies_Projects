    <div class="footer"><h2>Addendum</h2>
      <p>For the javascript, I chose to do a random number generator that generates
        a number between 0-100. I did this by looking at a similar example to get the script
        I needed. This was easier than I thought it was going to be since this was
        my first time writing in javascript. I looked into Math.floor and Math.random function
        to sort it out the way I needed to so I can produce the random outcome. Then I figured
        out to insert the button into the html and had .onclick inside the javascript.<br></p>
             <p>It was difficult to build the grid layout at first until I stumbled upon a YouTube
        video that gave me a better understanding between the html and css on how to
        build the grid. Once I got the css working I just had to adjust a couple of times to get
        the layout I wanted. Another challenge was the advertisement link since we have not dealt
        with placing an image into our html before. Once I got the images I wanted into my folder
        it was a breeze from there.
